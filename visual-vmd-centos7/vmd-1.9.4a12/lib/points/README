This code generates the point distribution for the solvent accessible
surface.  There should be no reason for you to use this code unless
you want to experiment with different/more/less point sets.  As such,
the documentation describing what to do is rather incomplete.  Here's
the rough outline.

The code to generate the point sets is from Jon Leech and is in
points.tar.gz .  You will have to uncompress and untar it yourself as
well as compile it.  This produces the program "distribute".  Copy it
to this (the parent) directory.


Run vmd_distribute.pl to generate the data files by multipley calling
Jon Leech's "distribute" code.  This makes point distributions for a
sphere used by the simple solvent accessible code in VMD.  

Then run vmd_data.pl to make the actual data file
("DrawMolItemSolvenPoints.data") used by VMD.

Finally (you must do this by hand) copy that file,
"./DrawMolItemSolventPoints.data" to your VMD source directory.


If you want to change the number of point/line samples, change
the line:
for($n = 30; $n < 256; $n *= 1.2) {
in vmd_distribute.pl

If you change the number of points then you should also remove all the
data files (*.vrml, *.lines, *.points) in the current directory, since
vmd_data.pl will pack _all_ the relevant files into the Draw.....data
file, including leftovers from a previous attempts.
