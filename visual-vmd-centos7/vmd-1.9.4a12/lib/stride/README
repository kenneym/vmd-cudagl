STRIDE is used by VMD to compute the secondary structure given the
protein 3D coordinates.  The appropriate STRIDE binary is included in
the VMD binary distribution.  To compile it yourself, see
http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/stride/
or
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/stride/src/stride.tar.gz
or 
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/extsrcs/Stride_src.tar.Z
(original home: http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/stride/stride_info.html)
for information on how to get the source and see ./lib/stride 
for information on how to use it with VMD.  
This code should be modified in two ways:

Change line 43 of stride.h from
 #define MAX_AT_IN_RES             50
to
 #define MAX_AT_IN_RES             75
because there are many structures with non-standard residues
containing more than 50 atoms.

Change line 96 of stride.c from
 return(SUCCESS);
to
 return(0);
since a program should return 0 if everything ended correctly.

When finished, copy the stride binary here with the proper suffix.
