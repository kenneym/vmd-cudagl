CAVE Library README
-------------------

  The CAVE is now marketed commercially, and libraries can't be distributed
with programs like VMD, only as a compiled binary.

If you don't know what the CAVE is, see http://evlweb.eecs.uic.edu/EVL/VR/ 
To get it, contact the EVL at UIC or NCSA at UIUC.  
Once you have it, the headers should be placed in './include' and 
the libraries in "lib_IRIX5" with "lib_IRIX6" being a symbolic link 
to "lib_IRIX5"

  The standard VMD distribution for SGIs is compiled with the cave
library built in.  To use that option, start VMD with the run-time
option "-dispdev cave".  To enable the VMD GUI in addition to the
cave, use the run-time option "-dispdev caveforms".

If you're an NCSA user, we build VMD with the libraries:
  /afs/ncsa/packages/cave/IRIX_5.2/Alternate/cave2.6.0g+
