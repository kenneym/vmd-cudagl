This README contains information about how to get VMD working with
Mesa.  This was tested with VMD 1.2b1 and Mesa 2.2 .  All file
references are assumed to be relative to vmd-1.2b1/lib/Mesa unless
otherwise stated.

  Download Mesa from iris.ssec.wisc.edu in the pub/Mesa directory.
Mesa is also mirrored on sunsite.unc.edu in the directory
pub/packages/development/graphics/mesa .  For more information, see
also http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html .  

  Compile it (and install if desired).  Please note that there seems
to be a bug/typo in the installation instructions.  It says:

  cp -r include/GL /usr/local/include

but this doesn't put the include files in the correct place, so
instead try:

  mkdir /usr/local/include/GL
  cp -r include/GL /usr/local/include/GL


  IF MESA IS INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE (and the include files are in
/usr/local/include/GL) then you don't have to modify the configure
script (../../configure).

  If Mesa is not in the standard location, edit the MESA_INCLUDE_DIR
and MESA_LIBRARY_DIR variables in the configure script to point to the
correct Mesa library and include files for this architecture.  Note
that the script doesn't quite get the ARCH variable set in the right
place to use it like you would expect for other libraries.  We really
need to rework that script.

  The needed Mesa libraries are libMesaGL.a and libMesaGLU.a.
